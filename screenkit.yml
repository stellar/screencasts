# ScreenKit project configuration file.
schema: 1

# The episodes directory is where the source files for each episode are stored.
# A new episode can be generated with `screenkit episode new`.
#
# The episode directory name can include placeholders:
# - %{episode_number}: The episode number
# - %{episode_slug}: A URL-friendly slug for the episode title
# - %{date}: The current timestamp in `yyyy-mm-dd` format.
#
# You can have padded episodes number by using a format string that looks like
# `%<episode_number>03d` (e.g. `001`).
episode_dir: episodes/%<episode_number>03d-%{episode_slug}

# The resources directory contains additional resource files used in the video.
# These can include images, sounds, fonts, etc.
# When defining your configuration, you can just specify the partial path. For
# instance, if you have an image at `resources/images/picture.png`, you can just
# refer to it as `images/picture.png`.
#
# You can also specify absolute paths, like system font directories.
#
# To point to the episode directory, use the placeholder `%{episode_dir}`.

# TTS configuration.
# To disable voiceover entirely, set `tts: false` or disable all engines
# individually.
#
# You can set up multiple TTS engines to be used as fallbacks in case one fails.
# Each TTS engine has its own detection mechanism. For instance, say and espeak
# checks for a binary with the same name. ElevenLabs checks for the presence of
# `--tts-api-key`.
#
# You can have multiple presets for the same engine. Just set a different
# configuration block using a different `id`. Then, when you're exporting the
# video, you can use `--tts-preset <id>`. If you don't provide a preset, the
# first available engine will be used.
